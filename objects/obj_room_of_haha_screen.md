## Description  
The screen shown in Squid's Presentation Room (RoomOfHaha).  
This screen changes its appearance based on the images you put in this directory:

These images will then be played in game as a "presentation" and allow you to make Squid react to whatever you want with the same script. 
The images must be titled in the following format:  
`Slide-[N]` Where N is the index the slide appears in the presentation loop.
The start at `Slide-1` and only go up to `Slide-11`.
